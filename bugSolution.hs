  -- Explanation of the behavior of sort with various list types
  putStrLn "The sort function sorts lists in ascending order. This is generally correct behavior, but a common misunderstanding is how it handles different data types, including potentially unexpected behavior with empty lists or lists containing only duplicate elements."  
  putStrLn "The sort function maintains the order of elements that are already sorted. For instance, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] remains unchanged when sorted." 
  putStrLn "When applied to an empty list [], it returns an empty list[]. This is expected behavior." 
  putStrLn "When applied to a list with duplicate elements, the elements retain their order.  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] remains unchanged when sorted." 
  putStrLn "When applied to a list of strings, it sorts them lexicographically." 

  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys -- Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

  let zs = [5,4,3,2,1]
  let ws = sort zs
  print ws -- Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

  let as = [1,3,5,2,4]
  let bs = sort as
  print bs -- Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

  let cs = []
  let ds = sort cs
  print ds -- Output: []

  let es = [1,1,1,1,1]
  let fs = sort es
  print fs --Output: [1,1,1,1,1]

  let gs = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
  let hs = sort gs
  print hs -- Output: ["apple","banana","cherry"]
